## Abstract
Apache CouchDB is a great database for web applications but its documentation is sparse, what makes it hard to follow. The project is a lot quieter right now but it is still being used and its several successors are thriving.
There are some points that make CouchDB compelling for the web and relevant for the future:
* The use of Erlang/OTP for resilience and fault tolerance.
* Simple REST API using web abstractions: very esay to use.
* Master/master replication.
There are some drawbacks and poor design choices but in general is very well conceived and is a fit for many web needs.

In one way or another, it will be some form of CouchDB for years to come
